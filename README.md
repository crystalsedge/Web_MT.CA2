# Web_MT.CA2
Hello, my name is Vishal Singh student number 10621604. My project is based on Ionic, with Angular being its framework.  I have also used Capacitor and Cordova. The main objective of this app is to let user who is booking a cab ride can provide the mobile’s location to help cab driver search for the passenger. My approach towards the project has been quite simple, the applications UI is a three tabs screen. On screen one the user can read about the application. On tab 2 user can select the mode of transport. On tab 3 user can allow device to use its location to provide coordinates. The application works on the browser, it compiles without any error but for some reasons the project cannot be built or generated as an .apk, .pkg, .xap file even using override commands such as --legacy-peers-deps, --force/--f. 
This might be due to hardware limitations, lack of knowledge about the topic, or failing to understand the commands and error messages thrown by the compiler. I have previously worked on the Android Studio and I am aware of its environment and etc. The most common repeated error during platform add was ‘An error occurred while running subprocess cordova.’ 
About this project, I made use of multiple sources to understand about Ionic and its aspects, such as Ionic Docs, npm.org, Stackoverflow etc.
Apart from build file, the working aspects of this project are location and device orientation. 
The project has a SplashScreen, icon assets, Toast message, List etc. I learned about the GPS coordinator capture plugin and thought to add it into this project. I worked on multiple projects for this assessment, but same error halted my progress. I will be linking my git repositories for the attempts I made.
